# PortMaster Wine - Fields of Mistria
This isn't really a port, it's Fields of Mistria running on wine64 and box64. It will boot and play on the Retroid Pocket 5 and Retroid Pocket Mini with a Rocknix distribution that has box64 and wine64 bundled. Such distributions (dev builds) can be found on the Rocknix Discord server.

## Installation
Copy the `fieldsofmistria` folder and `Fields of Mistria.sh` file to the same place you would normally place your port files e.g. `/roms/ports`. Purchase and install the game with Steam on Windows (or download the Windows depot) and copy all of its data to `fieldsofmistria/data`.

If you want to set up the emulationstation decorations, copy `cover.png` to the `fieldsofmistria` folder and copy the contents of `gameinfo.xml` to your `gamelist.xml` file.

This package features a texture repack, and the xdelta for it depends on checksum matching. The version used at time of writing is v0.12.4. If the game's had an update, I'll get to updating the xdelta asap.
